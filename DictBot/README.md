###Summoning the bot
The syntax for summoning /u/dictbot is easy. Simply write a comment on almost any subreddit with the syntax shown below.
> dictbot define **word or phrase**

The command above will give the definition for *word or phrase*

**Important notes**
  * A single space between "dictbot", "define", and the word.
  * When calling the bot, it must be the only thing written in the comment.
  * Capitlization does not matter.
